## Contributing
### Code and dependencies:
You'll need Git installed. If you are using Windows, replacing `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`
 - `git clone https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaks`
 - `./gradlew build` This should download all dependencies. You can test with `./gradlew runClient`
 - To get the deobfuscated sources run  `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`

Because of how the CCTweaks works, you may experience issues using the built in IDE tasks to run this project.
